# Flowering-Stage-ML


## Repository content
The data set includes: 100 recordings of shots made in the blackball billiard modality; 100 recordings of shots in the carom billiard modality; 100 recordings of shots in the snooker billiard modality. In addition, not only are these recordings available, but the exact positions have been obtained manually for a subset of each modality, carrying out comparisons with different methodologies and with the algorithm proposed in our work. Therefore, in the dataset we can find the following folders and files:
